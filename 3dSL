The text below is not part of this legal document; it is for reference purposes
only.

The general gist of this license is shown below.

Disclaimer: We cannot in any way guarantee that the gist matches the true
meaning of the license text. The gist is not legal advice. It's only a short
summary of the full text which may or may not have some slight issues.

Gist:
0. You can use the software to its full potential, and modify it if you wish.
   You may do this without needing to pay, without needing to sign in to any
   kind of service, without needing to provide any details to anyone or
   anything, or be related to anyone in any way.
1. If you are using a modified version privately and you aren't distributing it
   on the Internet, for example, you don't need to 
2. You can distribute the software to anyone for any reason, as long as you
   don't require them to pay, sign in to a service, provide any kind of
   details, or be related to anyone or know anyone in some way.
3. If you want to use or include portions of the software, its source code, or
   its documentation in other software for any reason, the other software must
   pass the following criteria:
      a. End users shouldn't need to pay, sign in to any kind of service,
         provide any details, or be related to someone or know someone in order
         to download it, its source code, and its documentation.
      b. End users shouldn't need to pay, sign in to any kind of service,
         provide any details, or be related to somoneone or know someone to use
         all features of the software. The software should work to its full
         potential out of the box indefinitely without having to "register" or
         "activate" it.
4. If you need to share source code, you must share it in a convenient format.
   You can't take a pixelated picture of your screen with your phone and call it
   source code.
      a. If the code is text-based like C, C++, Python, Java, Go, or dozens of
         other languages, share it in plaintext format which I can open with
         any basic text editor like Notepad. Again, anything less will not be
         tolerated. Even screenshots. (OCR technology has its quirks and not
         everyone has access to such software.)
      b. If the code is block-based like Scratch, share screenshot(s) with all   
         logic and assets visible or a file exported from whatever editor you
         use. Or if you are literally using an online service which doesn't let 
         you export files just make a little text note somewhere with this
         license text in it, and make sure that it's possible for people to
         easily copy or "fork" your code. (If the site requires people to sign
         in, pay, or provide details to run your code or modify it, I would
         really reconsider a bunch of things.)
