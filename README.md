# 3dOS License Suite

The name comes from a planned operating system project called the Three-Dimensional Operating System (3dOS for short, "three-dee O-ES").

The 3dOS Suite of Licenses are custom asset licenses that are focused on encouraging further expansion of ***public*** knowledge and science by not letting people make money off the stuff by means other than donations. It also doesn't let people keep modified forms of the assets secret, unless if it's for private use.

## But why?

I wrote these licenses because I believe that all computer-generated things and the stuff used to make them need to be available to the public for free, unless if it's for private use of course.

A prime example of one area of computer content that's slowly getting out of hand today is software. Adobe has always asked you for your wallet in order to use certain software they make; we're all familiar with that. That in itself is a bad thing, because let's ask ourselves again; *What is a computer?* A computer is one of the greatest inventions of man, a tool that lets anyone manipulate data and perform many many arithmetic operations very, very fast. When programmed correctly, you get a computer with a full-fledged operating system and applications which you can use to work, play, collaborate via network connections, and almost anything else. [Back in the 60&#39;s, people used to make software and distribute it and its source code for free, no questions asked.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin) But then Mr. Genius from IBM standardized selling software and hiding source code from the general public so they can't modify it so it fits their needs.
