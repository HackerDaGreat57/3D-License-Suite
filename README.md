# 3dOS License Suite

The name comes from a planned operating system project called the Three-Dimensional Operating System (3dOS for short, "three-dee O-ES").

The 3dOS Suite of Licenses are custom asset licenses that are focused on encouraging further expansion of ***public*** knowledge and science by not letting people make money off the stuff by means other than donations. It also doesn't let people keep modified forms of the assets secret, unless if it's for private use.

## But why?

I wrote these licenses because I believe that all computer-generated things and the stuff used to make them need to be available to the public for free, unless if it's for private use of course. There are multiple types of content that can be licensed with these licenses.

### Software

A prime example of one area of computer content that's slowly getting out of hand today is software. Adobe has always asked you for your wallet in order to use certain software they make; we're all familiar with that. But you may not realize that in itself is a bad thing, because let's ask ourselves again; ***What is a computer?***

A computer is one of the greatest inventions of man, a tool that's *supposed* to let *anyone* manipulate data and perform many many arithmetic operations very, very fast. When programmed correctly, you get a computer with a full-fledged operating system and applications which you can use to work, play, collaborate via network connections, and almost anything else. [Back in the early 60&#39;s, people used to make software and distribute it and its source code for free, no questions asked.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin) But then IBM standardized selling software and hiding source code from the general public so people can't modify it so it fits their needs. And in their case, they started *selling* it. This set the new standard for most software companies; putting source code behind lock & key and charging users to use the software after the "free trial" (or sometimes charging just to give customers access to software installer files).

These days, Adobe among other major software companies is moving to a subscription-based model. That means that you never truly 'own' the software and you have to keep paying for it indefnitely until you stop using it. Now, if you're thinking, "I'm sorry, WHAT?!", I'm sorry to say that this is the truth as of today. And it just gets worse as I keep explaining. Let's say you purchased an Adobe Creative Cloud license without even looking into open-source alternatives, and you currently pay them a monthly amount. You're a full-time photographer on your way to Africa to get some shots of the wildlife. That seems like it's gong to

But that's not what software was *meant to be*. Software is not something that is manufactured, shipped, and put on a shelf for a customer to pick up. Software is not
