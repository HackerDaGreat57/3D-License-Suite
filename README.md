# This README is still WIP. Excuse errors, please.

Work will begin on the actual license files after we decide the "gist" of every license here.

# Three-Dimensional License Suite

The 3D License Suite is a collection of custom asset licenses that are focused on encouraging further expansion of ***public*** knowledge and science by not letting people make money off the stuff by means other than donations/sponsorships. It also doesn't let people keep modified forms of the assets secret, unless if it's for private use.

## Licenses included in this set

There are multiple types of content that can be licensed with these licenses.

### Software (3dSL)

You have a perpetual license to use the software to its full potential. You may modify it as you wish, but if you are publicly distributing object/binary or documentation files of your modifications, then you need to also distribute source code of your modifications.

If you wish to use/include binary/object, source code, and/or documentation files of the software in other software, it must pass the following criteria:

1. Blah
2. Blah
3. Bleh

## What's up with the name?

The word "*Dimension*" in plain English means "an aspect or feature of a situation, problem, or thing." The licenses included in this repository qualify as *things* and they have specific *features* that make them different from other licenses.

## But why?

I wrote these licenses because I believe that almost all computer-generated things and the stuff used to make them need to be available to the public for free, unless if it's for private use of course.

### Software

A prime example of one area of computer content that's slowly getting out of hand today is software. Adobe has always asked you for your wallet in order to use certain software they make; we're all familiar with that. But you may not realize that in itself is a bad thing, because let's ask ourselves again; ***What is a computer?***

A computer is one of the greatest inventions of man, a tool that's *supposed* to let *anyone* manipulate data and perform many many arithmetic operations very, very fast. When programmed correctly, you get a computer with a full-fledged operating system and applications which you can use to work, play, collaborate via network connections, and almost anything else. [Back in the early 60&#39;s, people used to make software and distribute it and its source code for free, no questions asked.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Origin) But then IBM standardized selling software and hiding source code from the general public so people can't modify it so it fits their needs. This set the new standard for most software companies; putting source code behind lock & key and charging users to use the software after the "free trial" (or sometimes charging just to give customers access to software installer files).

These days, Adobe among other major software companies is moving (excuse me, *has moved*) to a subscription-based model. That means that you never truly 'own' the software and you have to keep paying for it indefnitely until you stop using it. Now, if you're thinking, "I'm sorry, WHAT?!", I'm sorry to say that this is the truth as of today. And it just gets worse as I keep explaining. Let's say you purchased an Adobe Creative Cloud license and you currently pay them monthly. You're a full-time photographer on your way to Africa to get some shots of the wildlife. However the spots you'll be going are known for having no Internet connection in *any* form. But who needs the Internet when you already licensed your software, right?? That seems like it's going to go alright, right???

But that's not what software was *meant to be*. Software is not something that is manufactured, shipped, and put on a shelf for a customer to pick up. Software is not
